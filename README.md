# Surfs Up!: An analysis geared toward investors

## Overview
I am seeking investors for a surf shop that also serves ice cream.  The proposed location is on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.  I have access to weather data including temperature and precipitation.  In order to determine if my business will be sustainable year round, my investors have asked for an indepth weather analysis of the area.  Specifically one investor would like to see a statistical breakdown of temperatures in June and December.

## Results
* The temperature measurements for [December](dec_temps.PNG) are fairly mild:
    * avg. 71 F
    * min. 56 F
    * max. 83 F
* The temperature measurements for [June](june_temps.PNG) are only slightly warmer than December:
    * avg. 75 F
    * min. 64 F
    * max. 86 F
* While the minimum temperature in December (56 F) is ten degrees lower than the June minimum temperature (64 F), the bottom quartile of the two months only differs by 4 degrees. 
* There are about 2,000 more temperature measurements taken in June.

## Summary
The temperature measurements differ only slighlty between June and December.  This aspect of the weather reflects that the surfing aspect of the business is viable year round.  Although the temperature drops somewhat in December, there are still a considerable number of days that reach temperatures over 70 degrees Farenheit.  After working up a sweat surfing, the weather is still perfect for ice cream!  

Another factor to consider is precipitation.  The precipitation levels in [June](june_prcp.PNG) and [December](dec_prcp.PNG) are very similar as well.  There is, on average, less than .25 inches of rain on any given day.  The primary investor requested data from one specific weather station, the station with the greatest number of measurements.  After pulling statistics from just this station for [June](june_meas.PNG) and [December](dec_meas.PNG), the trends ring true.  Mild temperatures paired with little precipitation create an excellent environment for both surfing and, on most days, ice cream!
